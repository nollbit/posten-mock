What?
=====

The Swedish Postal Service runs a package tracking API used by
a lot of web stores and third party utilities that provides 
package tracking for customers.

This is a (very incomplete) attempt at creating a mock of that service.

With the web interface, you'll be able to simulate
the package tracking API.

How?
====

This is a small web service that uses the [webapp framework][webapp]. It uses WSGI and you can
run it as is on [Google App Engine][gae].
